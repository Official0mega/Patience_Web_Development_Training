## Copy Command (cp)
* Takes two arguments
- cp first_arg second_arg
-    dir_name  file_to_copy

## Example Usage
* cp home.js ../file2

## Move or Rename Command (mv)
* The mv is used to move a file or a directory and can be used to rename a file or a directory.

## To make a Director (mdkir)
* mkdir css

## To remove only an Empty Directory (rmdir)
* rm is to remove
* dir is directory
- So, by combining rmdir, you'd be able to remove an empty directory.
* Example Usage:
- rmdir css
- The above command would remove the directory called `css`
```bash
rm
rmdir
rm -rf
```
## KeyNotes:
* rm is to remove a file
* rmdir is to remove an empty directory
* rm -rf is to remove a directory that contains contents in it.
## Be very conscious with the above commands.
